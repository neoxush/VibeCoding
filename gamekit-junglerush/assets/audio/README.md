# Audio Placeholders

This folder should contain the following audio files:

- `background-music.mp3` - Background music for the game
- `attack.wav` - Sound effect for attacks
- `hurt.wav` - Sound effect for taking damage

You can find free game audio assets from sources like Freesound.org, OpenGameArt.org, or create your own using tools like BFXR or JSFXR.
