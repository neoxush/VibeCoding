# JungleRush - Turn-Based Side-Scroller

A turn-based strategy game with side-scrolling elements, similar to Mario's stage design but with turn-based combat.

## Game Concept

In JungleRush, you control a character that can move side-to-side in a platformer world, similar to Mario. However, when you encounter enemies, the game switches to a turn-based battle system where you and the enemies take turns attacking each other.

### Key Features

- Side-scrolling platformer movement
- Turn-based combat system
- Random enemy encounters
- Multiple enemy types with different abilities
- Strategic battle options (Attack, Defend, Special)

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move your character left and right in the platformer world
2. Jump with the up arrow key
3. When you encounter an enemy, the game switches to battle mode
4. In battle mode, choose your action (Attack, Defend, or Special) each turn
5. Defeat all enemies to progress
