# Requirements Document

## Introduction

JungleRush is a turn-based side-scrolling platformer game built with Phaser 3. The game currently has all its code embedded in a single HTML file (game.html), making it difficult to maintain and extend. Additionally, there are separate modular JavaScript files (entities and scenes) that exist but are not being utilized. This feature aims to refactor the codebase to use the modular structure, complete missing functionality, and ensure the game is fully playable with proper asset management, sound effects, and game progression.

The refactoring will improve code maintainability, enable easier feature additions, and create a more professional game structure while preserving all existing gameplay mechanics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Architecture Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game code to be properly modularized into separate files, so that the codebase is maintainable and easier to extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is loaded THEN the system SHALL use the separate scene files (BootScene.js, GameScene.js, BattleScene.js, UIScene.js) instead of inline code in game.html
2. WHEN the game is loaded THEN the system SHALL use the separate entity files (Player.js, Enemy.js) instead of inline class definitions
3. WHEN the game.html file is opened THEN it SHALL only contain HTML structure, script imports, and game configuration
4. WHEN all scene and entity files are loaded THEN the game SHALL function identically to the current monolithic version
5. WHEN the main.js file is loaded THEN it SHALL contain only the game configuration and initialization code

### Requirement 2: Asset Loading System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper asset preloading system, so that the game can load textures, sounds, and other assets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display a loading screen with progress indication
2. WHEN assets are being loaded THEN the PreloadScene SHALL show the loading percentage
3. WHEN all assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically transition to the GameScene
4. WHEN the PreloadScene is active THEN it SHALL load all required textures, sounds, and other game assets
5. IF asset loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide fallback placeholder assets

### Requirement 3: Procedural Asset Generation

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to work without external asset files, so that I can play the game immediately without downloading additional resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL generate all required textures procedurally using Phaser graphics
2. WHEN textures are generated THEN they SHALL match the art style guide specifications
3. WHEN the game runs THEN it SHALL NOT require any external image files to function
4. WHEN textures are created THEN they SHALL be cached and reused throughout the game
5. WHEN the PreloadScene completes THEN all procedurally generated textures SHALL be available for use

### Requirement 4: Sound System Implementation

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear sound effects during gameplay, so that the game feels more immersive and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player attacks THEN the system SHALL play an attack sound effect
2. WHEN an entity takes damage THEN the system SHALL play a hurt sound effect
3. WHEN the player jumps THEN the system SHALL play a jump sound effect
4. WHEN an enemy is defeated THEN the system SHALL play a victory sound effect
5. WHEN the player dies THEN the system SHALL play a death sound effect
6. WHEN sounds are not available THEN the game SHALL continue to function without errors
7. WHEN the game loads THEN sound effects SHALL be generated procedurally or use Web Audio API

### Requirement 5: Game State Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game progress to be tracked properly, so that I can see my score, level, and statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize player stats (health, attack, defense, level, score)
2. WHEN an enemy is defeated THEN the system SHALL update the score and enemies defeated count
3. WHEN the player takes damage THEN the system SHALL update the player health display
4. WHEN the player health reaches zero THEN the system SHALL trigger a game over state
5. WHEN all enemies in a level are defeated THEN the system SHALL trigger level completion
6. WHEN the game state changes THEN the UI SHALL reflect the current state accurately

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Battle System

**User Story:** As a player, I want the battle system to be fully functional with all actions working correctly, so that I can strategically defeat enemies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player selects "Attack" THEN the system SHALL calculate damage based on player attack stat and apply it to the enemy
2. WHEN the player selects "Defend" THEN the system SHALL temporarily increase player defense for the next enemy attack
3. WHEN the player selects "Special" THEN the system SHALL perform a high-damage attack that costs player health
4. WHEN it is the enemy's turn THEN the system SHALL calculate damage based on enemy attack minus player defense
5. WHEN an entity's health reaches zero THEN the battle SHALL end with appropriate victory or defeat outcome
6. WHEN the battle ends THEN the system SHALL return to the GameScene and remove defeated enemies

### Requirement 7: Level Progression System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to progress through multiple levels or stages, so that the game has replay value and increasing difficulty.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all enemies in the current level are defeated THEN the system SHALL display a level complete message
2. WHEN a level is completed THEN the system SHALL increase the level counter
3. WHEN a new level starts THEN the system SHALL spawn enemies with increased difficulty
4. WHEN the player completes a level THEN the system SHALL restore some player health as a reward
5. WHEN the level increases THEN enemy health and attack stats SHALL scale appropriately

### Requirement 8: Player Death and Respawn

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to restart after dying, so that I can continue playing without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player falls into the killzone THEN the system SHALL trigger player death
2. WHEN the player health reaches zero in battle THEN the system SHALL trigger player death
3. WHEN the player dies THEN the system SHALL display a game over screen with final score
4. WHEN the game over screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Restart" button
5. WHEN the player clicks "Restart" THEN the system SHALL reset game state and return to the beginning
6. WHEN the game restarts THEN all player stats SHALL be reset to initial values

### Requirement 9: Code Quality and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be well-documented and follow best practices, so that future maintenance and feature additions are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any class or function THEN it SHALL have clear JSDoc comments explaining its purpose
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all magic numbers SHALL be replaced with named constants
3. WHEN reviewing the code THEN complex logic SHALL have inline comments explaining the approach
4. WHEN reviewing the file structure THEN it SHALL follow a logical organization pattern
5. WHEN reviewing the code THEN it SHALL follow consistent naming conventions throughout

### Requirement 10: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the refactored code works correctly, so that no functionality is lost during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactored game loads THEN all scenes SHALL initialize without errors
2. WHEN the player moves and jumps THEN the controls SHALL respond identically to the original version
3. WHEN the player encounters an enemy THEN the battle SHALL start correctly
4. WHEN battle actions are performed THEN they SHALL produce the same results as the original version
5. WHEN the game is tested THEN all visual effects and animations SHALL work as expected
6. WHEN the game runs THEN there SHALL be no console errors during normal gameplay
