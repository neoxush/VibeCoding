Random-sized blockouts on both sides with varied positions!

## Quick Setup (30 seconds):

### Method 1: Use the Preset (Coming Soon)
1. Load "Urban Street" preset
2. Click Generate
3. Done!

### Method 2: Manual Setup (Current)

1. **Create/Select Spline**
   - Click "Create Default Spline" or select your own

2. **Enable Road Mode**
   - Check "Road Mode: ON"

3. **Set These Parameters:**
   ```
   Road Mode:
   ├─ Road Width: 8m
   └─ Side: Both
   
   Layout Parameters:
   ├─ Spacing: 3m (closer = more blockouts)
   ├─ Path Width: 8m
   ├─ Lateral Density: 0.0 (no branches)
   └─ Space Size Variation: 0.6 (HIGH for variety)
   
   Building Blocks:
   ├─ Grid Size: 2m
   ├─ Wall Height: 4m
   └─ Block Types: Walls, Floors, Platforms
   
   Terrain:
   ├─ Enable Terrain: ON
   ├─ Height Variation: 2m (low for flat)
   └─ Smoothness: 0.8 (smooth road)
   ```

4. **Click "Generate"**

## What Makes It Random:

### Size Variation:
- Width: 70-150% of base size
- Depth: 70-150% of base size  
- Height: 80-130% of wall height
- Each blockout is different!

### Position Variation:
- Distance from road: 80-140% of base offset
- Along road: ±1.5m random shift
- Creates organic, non-uniform look

### Key Parameters:

**Space Size Variation: 0.6**
- Higher = more size variety
- 0.6 = good balance of variety

**Spacing: 3m**
- Smaller = more blockouts
- 3m = dense urban feel
- Try 2m for very dense
- Try 5m for sparse

**Road Width: 8m**
- Width of clear path
- 8m = standard street
- 10m = wide avenue
- 5m = narrow alley

## Tips for Best Results:

### For Dense Urban:
```
Spacing: 2-3m
Space Size Variation: 0.6-0.8
Road Width: 6-8m
```

### For Sparse Suburban:
```
Spacing: 5-8m
Space Size Variation: 0.4-0.6
Road Width: 10-12m
```

### For Varied Heights:
```
Wall Height: 3-5m
Space Size Variation: 0.7+
(Heights will vary 80-130%)
```

### For Organic Look:
```
Space Size Variation: 0.6+
Spacing: 2-4m
(Creates clustered, random feel)
```

## Randomization Features:

✓ **Random widths** - Each blockout different width
✓ **Random depths** - Each blockout different depth
✓ **Random heights** - Varies 80-130% of wall height
✓ **Random offsets** - Not perfectly aligned
✓ **Random distances** - Some closer/further from road
✓ **Random along path** - Slight shifts forward/backward

## Quick Variations:

**More Variety:**
- Increase "Space Size Variation" to 0.8

**Tighter Spacing:**
- Decrease "Spacing" to 2m

**Wider Road:**
- Increase "Road Width" to 12m

**Different Seed:**
- Click "Randomize Seed" for new layout

## Troubleshooting:

**Blockouts too uniform?**
→ Increase "Space Size Variation" to 0.7+

**Too sparse?**
→ Decrease "Spacing" to 2-3m

**Blockouts overlapping road?**
→ Increase "Road Width"

**Not random enough?**
→ Increase "Space Size Variation"
→ Click "Randomize Seed"

**Pro Tip:** After generating, click "Randomize Seed" and generate again to get a completely different random layout with the same parameters!
