1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL work as a static web application without server requirements
2. WHEN the code is modified THEN the system SHALL not require compilation or build steps
3. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL load them via CDN to avoid local installation
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load quickly with minimal external dependencies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and load my 3D scenes, so that I can preserve my work and share designs with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user exports a scene THEN the system SHALL save all object data and camera positions in JSON format
2. WHEN the user imports a scene file THEN the system SHALL restore all objects and camera state accurately
3. WHEN the user exports scenes THEN the system SHALL support multiple export formats including OBJ for external use
4. WHEN the user manages files THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback for successful and failed operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced visual and material options, so that I can better differentiate and visualize different elements in my design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects an object THEN the system SHALL provide material property controls including opacity and wireframe mode
2. WHEN the user views the scene THEN the system SHALL offer different viewport display modes including wireframe view
3. WHEN the user works with materials THEN the system SHALL provide preset material options for common use cases
4. WHEN the user needs precision THEN the system SHALL provide measurement and alignment tools for accurate positioning

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use a designated size of canvas, and switch between 2D and 3D mode to easily change blockout layout

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a view mode (2D or 3D) from a settings panel THEN the system SHALL toggle the canvas between a 3D perspective view and a 2D orthographic top-down view without reloading the scene
2. WHEN the user places or manipulates objects in 2D view THEN the system SHALL reflect changes accurately in the 3D view, maintaining object properties (e.g., position, color, material)
3. WHEN the user places or manipulates objects in 3D view THEN the system SHALL reflect changes accurately in the 2D view, ensuring consistent object placement relative to the grid
4. WHEN the user switches views THEN the system SHALL preserve the camera position (e.g., 2D view aligns with the 3D viewâ€™s top-down perspective) and object selection state
5. WHEN the user interacts in 2D view THEN the system SHALL provide a simplified interface with grid-based snapping and 2D transform controls (position, scale) optimized for layout planning
