# 2D/3D Mode Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for seamless integration between 2D professional drawing mode and 3D blockout mode in the 3D Blockout Toolkit. The goal is to create a unified workflow where users can sketch ideas in 2D and instantly convert them to 3D objects, or work directly in 3D and see 2D representations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mode Switching

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to seamlessly switch between 2D and 3D modes, so that I can work with the most appropriate tool for each task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "2D Sketch" button THEN the interface SHALL switch to 2D drawing mode with professional drawing tools
2. WHEN I click the "3D Mode" button THEN the interface SHALL switch to 3D blockout mode with 3D manipulation tools
3. WHEN switching modes THEN the current work SHALL be preserved and remain accessible
4. WHEN switching modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and take less than 500ms
5. WHEN in 2D mode THEN I SHALL see professional drawing tools (precision line, smart rectangle, intelligent circle, annotation tool, eraser)
6. WHEN in 3D mode THEN I SHALL see 3D manipulation tools (move, rotate, scale, primitive creation)

### Requirement 2: Professional 2D Drawing Tools

**User Story:** As a designer, I want professional-grade 2D drawing tools, so that I can create precise sketches and layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the precision line tool THEN I SHALL be able to draw straight lines with snap-to-grid functionality
2. WHEN using the smart rectangle tool THEN I SHALL be able to draw rectangles with optional square constraint (Shift key)
3. WHEN using the intelligent circle tool THEN I SHALL be able to draw circles from center-radius interaction
4. WHEN using the annotation tool THEN I SHALL be able to add text annotations that specify 3D object types
5. WHEN using the eraser tool THEN I SHALL be able to remove drawing elements by proximity
6. WHEN drawing THEN I SHALL see real-time visual feedback including construction lines and dimensions
7. WHEN drawing THEN I SHALL have access to professional grid with major/minor lines and origin axes

### Requirement 3: 2D to 3D Conversion

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to convert my 2D sketches to 3D objects, so that I can quickly prototype spatial layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add annotations to my 2D sketch THEN the system SHALL recognize object types from text (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, torus, plane)
2. WHEN I click "Generate 3D" THEN the system SHALL convert annotated areas to corresponding 3D objects
3. WHEN converting to 3D THEN the system SHALL use 2D coordinates to determine 3D positions with appropriate scaling
4. WHEN converting to 3D THEN generated objects SHALL have distinctive visual styling (different color) to indicate sketch origin
5. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to 3D mode to show results
6. WHEN conversion is complete THEN I SHALL see a summary of objects created

### Requirement 4: Coordinate System Integration

**User Story:** As a designer, I want consistent coordinate mapping between 2D and 3D modes, so that spatial relationships are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting 2D coordinates to 3D THEN the 2D canvas center SHALL map to 3D world origin (0,0,0)
2. WHEN converting coordinates THEN the 2D X-axis SHALL map to 3D X-axis
3. WHEN converting coordinates THEN the 2D Y-axis SHALL map to 3D Z-axis (inverted for proper orientation)
4. WHEN converting coordinates THEN appropriate scaling SHALL be applied (e.g., 50 pixels = 1 world unit)
5. WHEN placing 3D objects THEN they SHALL be positioned at appropriate heights above the ground plane

### Requirement 5: Visual Feedback and User Experience

**User Story:** As a designer, I want clear visual feedback and intuitive controls, so that I can work efficiently in both modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in 2D mode THEN I SHALL see live cursor coordinates in the properties panel
2. WHEN drawing THEN I SHALL see real-time dimensions and measurements
3. WHEN using tools THEN I SHALL see appropriate cursor styles for each tool
4. WHEN hovering over snap points THEN I SHALL see visual indicators for different snap types
5. WHEN switching tools THEN the active tool SHALL be clearly highlighted in the UI
6. WHEN working THEN I SHALL have access to keyboard shortcuts for common operations
7. WHEN annotations are present THEN I SHALL see a list of annotations with metadata in the properties panel

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence and Management

**User Story:** As a designer, I want my 2D sketches and 3D objects to be properly managed, so that I can maintain organized projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create 2D drawing elements THEN they SHALL be stored persistently during the session
2. WHEN I create annotations THEN they SHALL include metadata (timestamp, object type, position)
3. WHEN I generate 3D objects from sketches THEN they SHALL maintain references to their 2D origins
4. WHEN I clear the 2D sketch THEN I SHALL be prompted for confirmation
5. WHEN I switch modes THEN the current state SHALL be preserved
6. WHEN objects are created from sketches THEN they SHALL have distinctive naming (e.g., "sketch_cube_1")

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a designer, I want robust error handling, so that I can work without interruption from technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 2D canvas fails to initialize THEN I SHALL see a clear error message
2. WHEN I try to generate 3D objects without annotations THEN I SHALL be prompted to add annotations first
3. WHEN drawing tools encounter errors THEN the system SHALL gracefully recover without losing work
4. WHEN switching modes fails THEN I SHALL be notified and the system SHALL remain in the current mode
5. WHEN coordinate conversion fails THEN default safe positions SHALL be used
6. WHEN browser compatibility issues occur THEN I SHALL see appropriate fallback behavior

### Requirement 8: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a designer, I want smooth and responsive interactions, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN drawing in 2D mode THEN interactions SHALL respond within 16ms for 60fps performance
2. WHEN switching between modes THEN the transition SHALL complete within 500ms
3. WHEN generating 3D objects THEN the conversion SHALL complete within 2 seconds for typical sketches
4. WHEN redrawing the 2D canvas THEN it SHALL complete within 100ms for typical drawings
5. WHEN the canvas contains many elements THEN performance SHALL remain acceptable (>30fps)
6. WHEN resizing the window THEN both 2D and 3D viewports SHALL adapt smoothly
