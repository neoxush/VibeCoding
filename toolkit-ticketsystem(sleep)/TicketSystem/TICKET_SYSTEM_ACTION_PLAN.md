# Ticket System Action Plan

This document outlines the prioritized action plan for addressing the issues identified in the Ticket System analysis.

## Priority Issues Overview

1. **Data Synchronization Problems** (Highest Priority)
   - Asynchronous flow issues
   - Lack of proper Promise handling
   - Race conditions
   - Inconsistent data loading

2. **Status Management Issues** (High Priority)
   - Incorrect initial status
   - Inconsistent status constants
   - Missing status transitions

3. **UI Display Issues** (Medium Priority)
   - Conditional display logic problems
   - Incomplete rendering logic
   - Missing UI refresh

4. **Network and Server Issues** (Medium Priority)
   - One-way synchronization
   - Missing error handling
   - Lack of real-time updates

## Detailed Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Core Data Synchronization (Highest Priority)

#### 1.1 Implement Promise-Based API
- [x] Refactor createTicket function to return Promises
- [x] Refactor updateTicketStatus function to return Promises
- [x] Refactor closeTicket function to return Promises
- [x] Refactor submitForApproval function to return Promises
- [ ] Refactor other key functions (getTicketById, getAllTickets) to support async patterns
- [x] Add proper error handling for all asynchronous operations
- [x] Update UI functions to handle returned Promises correctly

#### 1.2 Ensure Consistent Data Loading
- [x] Implement loadFromServer function to get fresh data
- [x] Always load fresh data from server before displaying on dashboard
- [ ] Add loading indicators during data fetching operations
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed data loading
- [ ] Add data validation to ensure data integrity

### Phase 2: Fix Status Management (High Priority)

#### 2.1 Standardize Status Constants
- [x] Ensure consistent use of TICKET_STATUS constants throughout the codebase
- [ ] Document the meaning and flow of each status in code comments
- [ ] Create a status flow diagram for documentation
- [ ] Add validation to prevent invalid status values

#### 2.2 Fix Status Transitions
- [x] Fix initial ticket status (pending_approval instead of open)
- [ ] Implement proper status transition logic (which statuses can transition to which)
- [ ] Add validation for status changes to prevent invalid transitions
- [ ] Ensure all UI components reflect status changes immediately

### Phase 3: Improve UI Display (Medium Priority)

#### 3.1 Enhance Rendering Logic
- [x] Fix pending approvals display for admins and approvers
- [ ] Ensure all UI sections update consistently after data changes
- [ ] Fix conditional display logic for different user roles
- [ ] Implement better empty states for lists with no items
- [ ] Add better error states for failed operations
- [x] Replace intrusive toast notifications with a collapsible log panel
- [ ] Ensure UI improvements are applied consistently across all user types (regular users, approvers, admins)

#### 3.2 Implement Reliable UI Refresh
- [x] Add periodic dashboard refresh to show latest data
- [ ] Implement debouncing to prevent excessive refreshes
- [ ] Add visual indicators for data freshness (last updated timestamp)
- [ ] Implement manual refresh button for users to force update
- [ ] Add notifications for important data changes

### Phase 4: Enhance Network and Server Communication (Medium Priority)

#### 4.1 Implement Bidirectional Synchronization
- [x] Ensure data is saved to server after local changes
- [x] Ensure data is loaded from server before displaying
- [ ] Add proper error recovery for network failures
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- [ ] Add offline data caching for better performance

#### 4.2 Add Real-Time Updates
- [ ] Research WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
- [ ] Add server-sent events or polling for data changes
- [ ] Implement notifications for important events
- [ ] Add online/offline indicators
- [ ] Implement offline support with data synchronization when reconnecting

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining items in Phase 1 (Data Synchronization)
2. Move on to Phase 2 (Status Management) items
3. Reassess priorities after completing Phases 1 and 2
4. Consider implementing selected items from Phases 3 and 4 based on user feedback

## Progress Tracking

- **Phase 1**: 7/12 items completed (58%)
- **Phase 2**: 1/8 items completed (12.5%)
- **Phase 3**: 3/12 items completed (25%)
- **Phase 4**: 2/10 items completed (20%)

**Overall Progress**: 13/42 items completed (31%)
