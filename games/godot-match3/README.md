## 🛠️ Development

This project was built using **Godot 4.x** with GDScript. Key implementation details:

- **Grid-based Logic**: The game board is managed as a 2D array for efficient match detection
- **Tween Animations**: Smooth candy swapping and falling animations
- **Particle System**: GPU-accelerated particle effects for match explosions
- **SVG Assets**: Vector graphics for crisp visuals at any resolution
